Cobalt Blue WordPress Theme
===========================

Cobalt Blue is a general-purpose, full-width, responsive, hi-DPI-ready, HTML5 WordPress theme built without messy web libraries or any JavaScript. It is designed to be ultra-fast and soothing to the eye. The theme features a 2 column layout, customizable header plus header image, excellent styling for all default widgets, and navigation menu support.

The theme is blue, as you can guess from its name. The exact shades of blue used follow a mathematically consistent pattern from black to blue to white:

 1. #000000 (black)
 1. #121f27
 1. #1e3442
 1. #2b4a5d
 1. #375f78
 1. #447492
 1. #508aad
 1. #6a9cba
 1. #85aec7
 1. #a0c0d3
 1. #bbd1df
 1. #d5e3ec
 1. #f0f5f8
 1. #ffffff (white)

If you are not fond of the color blue, maybe the demo will change your mind.
